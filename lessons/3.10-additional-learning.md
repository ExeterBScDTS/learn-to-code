We've introduced a number of new HTML, CSS and design concepts. Before progressing, you should practice these and make sure you are comfortable writing HTML and CSS.

We recommend completing these courses, which will probably take around a day to complete:

1. [Codecademy HTML course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)
2. [Codecademy CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

<div class="todo">Unless you are already familiar with HTML and CSS, complete the Codecademy courses before continuing.</div>
