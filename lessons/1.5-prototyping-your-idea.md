Now you've got a list of user stories that describe your idea, let's think about translating those into things that your users will actually see on screen.

We're going to create some **prototypes**. These can be made with code, but to keep things simple, we're going to use paper.

> Usually, we'd go through many rounds of prototyping to avoid **building the wrong thing**. This isn't a course about agile delivery or user-centred design, so we're going to pretend we've already done all that.

## What you need
Any kind of paper and pen will do. Some people prefer sharpies and A3 sheets, some people prefer pencils and notebooks.

Whatever you have on hand will probably be fine.

## Common prototyping conventions
You can draw your prototypes in any way that makes sense to you, but here are some common conventions to get you started.

First, start by drawing the boundaries of your user's screen. You don't know how tall the screen you're designing will be, so **only draw the top, left and right sides.**

Starting at the top, draw the basic elements of your design: text, images, buttons, user input fields and similar. Don't worry about writing real text. That can be refined later.

Once you are happy with the prototype, annotate it in detail so that a stranger could understand it. This is valuable skill because designers rarely work in isolation, and will help you remember why you made certain decisions.

Keep these prototypes safe along with your user stories, to refer back to later. Make sure you've added enough detail to your annotations that your decisions will still make sense to you later on.

> Service designers, user researchers and interaction designers often make use of the **[GDS prototyping kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)** to do this kind of work.

## Completeness
It's not a good idea to start coding without a clear idea of what you want the result to look like.

Make sure that your prototypes have covered everything the user is likely to see on your app.

Next, we'll think about sharing and refining your work.
