You can describe your idea in any way that makes sense to you.

If you are familiar with [user research and user-centred design](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/understand-user-needs), you may want to express your idea in terms of **user stories**.

A user story describes a feature in terms of something your user needs or wants to accomplish.

> These stories should [result from user research on real people](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs#linking-user-needs-to-user-stories). Since this isn't a user research course, we're going to cheat and pretend we've already done that part.

## Writing user stories
User stories can be phrased like:

```
As a user...
I want to...
So I can...
```

For instance, a conference app may have needs like:

```
As a conference delegate,
I want to see a list of the events available,
So I can go to the ones that interest me.
```

You should come up with at least three of these, and keep them safe, referring back to them as you design your app.

Ideally, consider more than one kind of user. A conference app would consider the needs of delegates and organisers, for instance.

GDS has [plenty of guidance](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/writing-user-stories) on writing good user stories.

		<p>Use the user stories format to write out a detailed list of what your app needs to do</p>
