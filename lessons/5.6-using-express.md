title: Using Express
module: Web servers
order: 6
type: project

Now that we've installed Express, it's time to start writing our app's server code.

First we're going to configure Express.

<div class="todo">
  From the projects explorer, delete the hello.js file we used earlier and create a new blank file called server.js.
</div>

In `server.js`, write the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express')

let server = express()

server.use(express.static('public'))

server.listen(3000, function(){
    console.log("Server is running.")
})
```

The **first line** makes Express available to use in our code, saving it as a variable.

The **second line** takes the Express code and runs it.

The **third** line will be explained in the next module.

The final block of code makes Express available on the internet.
