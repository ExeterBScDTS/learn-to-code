Often, we will want to reuse parts of a webpage on other webpages.

Most websites have a header and footer that are very similar on all pages of the site. [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk/) is no exception.

In plain HTML, this is hard to do. Every new webpage needs to be written in full, even if most of the page isn't unique.

If our header or footer needs to change, we would have to make that change in many files.

Nunjucks solves this problem with a feature called **includes**.

## Keep includes organised
To save confusion, we should keep all includes (parts of pages) separate from the full view templates we've used so far.

Create a subfolder of `/views` called `/includes`. Create a file called `header.njk`.

We're going to use this include at the top of every page in our app, so let's give it our app's title and a menu:

```html
<header>
  <h1>My App</h1>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```

Now go to your `index.njk` view template, and add the following line to the top of the file:

```html
{% include "includes/header.njk" %}
```

Do the same in the `about.njk` file.

When a user requests the view, this tag is replaced by the HTML from the file it references.

Restart your app and check the results in the browser. You should see the same header on both pages.

<div class="todo">Use this same approach to give your app a footer. Referring to your prototypes, decide what includes your own app will need to make use of.</div>
