Consider the following HTML.
```
<div class="summary">
  <h1 id="emphasised">Make this text red</h1>
  <h2>Not this text</h2>
</div>
<div>
  <h1>Not this text</h1>
</div>
```

What CSS would we have to write to make the first `<h1>` element turn red, but not the second one?

<div class="todo">Copy this HTML across to Codepen and experiment with the following CSS examples.</div>

## Tag selectors
We can target all content inside a HTML tag of a certain type with a CSS statement like:
```
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```
However, that won't work in this situation, because both `<h1>` elements will turn red.

## Class selectors
We can also target HTML classes, such as the class `summary` on the first `<div>`, by putting a **full stop** before the selector.
```
.summary {
  color: red;
}
```
However, that still won't work, because both the `<h1>` and `<h2>` will turn red.

## Chaining selectors
We can write chained selectors like this.

```
.summary h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

This CSS statement will do what we need. Because we used a chained selector, we are targeting **all `<h1>` elements inside anything with a class of `summary`**.

## ID selectors
There is one other solution which will work. We can target the ID of the `<h1>` element we want to turn red by putting a hash (`#`) before the ID name.

```
#emphasised {
  color: red;
}
```

<div class="todo">Try and write a CSS rule to change the colour of the h2 element instead.</div>
