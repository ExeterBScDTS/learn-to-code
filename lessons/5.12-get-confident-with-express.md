title: Get confident with Express
module: Web servers

We've now covered a range of web server concepts, including:

- The terminal
- Routes
- Adding real data to views
- Serving static files like CSS
- Templating with nunjucks

The next step is to adapt the Express app we've built to the prototypes from earlier modules.

Before that, you should make sure you feel confident with these concepts.

## Tutorials and courses

Unless you're already confident with Express, complete [Codecademy's Express course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-express).

You may also want to look at these tutorials:

- [Mozilla Express tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)
- [Net Ninja Youtube Node.js and Express tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&vl=en-GB)

Most tutorials will teach things that we haven't covered here, and may miss things that we have covered.

That's okayâ€”there are many ways to work with frameworks like Express, and all of them are valid.

## GOV.UK prototyping kit

The technologies we've used here, including Node.js, Express and nunjucks, are also used by the GOV.UK prototyping kit.

Completing the [basic tutorials](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs/tutorials-and-examples) for the prototyping kit can help you become more confident using these technologies.

## Documentation

You may find the [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) documentation useful.

These docs cover a lot of advanced concepts that aren't relevant to the app we're building. Don't feel like you have to read through irrelevant material.
