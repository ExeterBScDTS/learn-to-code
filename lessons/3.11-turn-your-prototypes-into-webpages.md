title: Turn your prototypes into webpages
module: Building webpages
order: 11
type: learn
---

Now, we're going to take the paper prototypes we created in the last module and translate them into webpages, using our new HTML and CSS knowledge.

You'll need;

* The user stories for your app.
* Your paper prototypes from the previous module.
* Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

This is a good chance to revisit your original user stories and decide whether your drawings are still the best way to meet those needs.

You may want to refine your drawings first based on your new HTML and CSS knowledge.

<div class="todo">
		<h2>To-do</h2>
		<ol>
		    <li>Create a new pen in Codepen for each screen you drew in the last module.</li>
				<li>Write the necessary HTML and CSS for what you want the user to see on each screen.</li>
				<li>Get feedback on your work from fellow learners.</li>				
		</ol>
</div>

<div class="inset">Consider <a href="/feedback">leaving feedback</a> for this module.</div>
