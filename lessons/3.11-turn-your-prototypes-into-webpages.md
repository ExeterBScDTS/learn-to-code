title: Turn your prototypes into webpages
module: Building webpages
order: 11
type: project
---

Now, we're going to take the paper prototypes we created in the last module and translate them into webpages, using our new HTML and CSS knowledge.

You'll need;

* The user stories for your app.
* Your paper prototypes from the previous module.
* Basic knowledge of HTML and CSS.

This is a good chance to revisit your original user stories and decide whether your drawings are still the best way to meet those needs.

> Pay close attention to the kind of **data you need to capture from users**, and the best way to design a form to capture that data.

You may want to refine your drawings first based on your new HTML and CSS knowledge.

				<li>Get feedback on your work from fellow learners.</li>
