title: Get confident with Javascript
module: Adding interactivity
order: 9
type: learn
---

We've now covered everything you need to add basic interactive features to your webpages.

Make sure you're confident with the topics we've covered before you continue.

We recommend attempting:

- [Codecademy Javascript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript).
- [W3Schools Javascript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jS/default.asp)

It will take several days to complete both of these. You don't need to complete it all.

## Keep your learning focused

You don't have to master Javascript to complete this course.

Most resources on the web, including those we've linked here, teach many topics that aren't necessary for what we need to accomplish for this project.

You can spend time learning these extra topics if you want, but once you feel confident using these core concepts, feel free to move on:

- Variables
- If statements
- Selecting elements from webpages and saving them as variables
- Event listeners
- Adding and removing classes

<div class="todo">Unless you are already familiar with HTML and CSS, complete the first few modules of the Codecademy Javascript course before continuing.</div>
