> Digital teams should **[show their work to stakeholders regularly](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/agile-tools-techniques#team-review-show-and-tell)**, to spot potential issues early and avoid costly mistakes.

You've now come up with an idea, expressing it in terms of user stories, and drawing prototypes.

Before progressing to the next module, get some feedback. You can use the *#ddat-codelabs* channel on Slack to do this if you like.

You can also [email](mailto:ddatcodelabs@gmail.com) the DDaT Codelabs volunteer team for feedback if you don't have access to Slack.

Seek honest critique and incorporate changes to your prototypes if necessary.
