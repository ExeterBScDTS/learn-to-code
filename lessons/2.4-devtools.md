> If possible, use the Chrome browser for this lesson. If you can't, Safari, Firefox or Edge will also work. If you only have access to Internet Explorer, skip this lesson.

Let's put some of the principles we've learned into practice.

Every modern web browser comes with a set of tools to make developing web pages easier. We can use them to understand how a web page is put together, and what happens in the background as we browse around the web.

Each browser has a slightly different way of accessing its dev tools, and organises them in a slightly different way. If possible, use Chrome for this lesson. In Chrome, right click the web page anywhere, and click Inspect.

Instructions for other browsers:

* [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools)
* [Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/GettingStarted/GettingStarted.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007874-CH2-SW1)
