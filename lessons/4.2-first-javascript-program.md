We're now going to write some simple Javascript programs.

The first line of Javascript we wrote was in our browser's developer tools console.

This isn't ideal for writing longer programs, because each line of code runs as soon as we hit the return key. We want to write several lines of code (a program or **script**) and run it once at the end.

Instead, we're going to write some javascript along with our prototypes on Codepen.

We can write code in the JS panel of a Codepen prototype.

<div class="todo">
	<p>Go to one of your prototypes up on Codepen, and make sure the JS panel is visible.</p>
	<p>Click the "Console" button at the bottom left of the screen to reveal a Javascript console.</p>  
</div>
