The strength of Javascript compared to simpler languages like HTML and CSS is logic.

Javascript programs can **run code in response to circumstances**.


## Check two things are the same

We can test whether two things are equal by using **two equals signs** together:

```javascript
let age = 30

console.log(age == 35)
```
It's important to use two signs. Using a single sign does something differentâ€”it assigns a value to a variable.

In the above example, we will see the message `false` logged to the console, because age does not equal 35.

If the two things were equal, we would see the message `true` instead.


## If statements

The simplest form of logic is the **if statement**.

An if statement has a **condition**, and some code to run if the condition is true.

```javascript
let age = 30

if (age == 30) {
	console.log("The age is 30!")
}
```

In this example, the if statement will print a message to the console, because `age` does indeed equal 30.

We can put whatever code we like inside the curly brackets. We could even put more if statements inside.

## If/else statements

We can also provide a second block of code to run if the condition is **not** true.

```javascript
let age = 30

if (age == 30) {
	console.log("The age is 30!")
} else {
	console.log("The age is NOT 30!")
}
```

	<p>Try to create an if statement with a block of code that runs only when two conditions are true.</p>
