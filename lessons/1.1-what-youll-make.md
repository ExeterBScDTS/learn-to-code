Over the modules of this course, we're going to create a working web application that runs in a browser and which users can interact with.

This project will help you learn:

* programming fundamentals
* the ideas and technology responsible for the world wide web
* parts of the [Digital Service Standard ](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) (soon to be the Government Service Standard)
* the [technology section of the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology)

We will revisit your app in each of the six modules - adding functionality to it as we learn.

Alongside that, we will build a number of simple "toy" apps to demonstrate key concepts. These will *not* be revisited.

## What kind of app?
You can build any app you like, within reason. You can duplicate an app that already exists or come up with something original.

To get the most out of this course we ask that your app idea follows particular guidelines. This is to make sure that the things this course teaches will actually be useful and applicable to your app.
