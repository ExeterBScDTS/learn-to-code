Let's consider the HTML tag for an image.

```
<img src="http://placehold.it/80x80" alt="An image" />
```

You'll notice that this is a self-closing tag.  That makes sense because images don't have text "inside" them in the same way a paragraph or heading would.

You'll also notice two **attributes**:

* src, or source
* alt, or alt-text

We use these attributes to specify the URL of the image file we want to display, and some alt-text that will be read out by a screen reader for visually impaired users.

Attributes have a name, an equals sign, and then a value **inside double-quote marks**. Don't forget the quote marks.

Here is another example of a tag with an attribute:

```
<a href="http://google.com">Click me</a>
```

This is an anchor tag, more commonly known as a hyperlink. Unlike the `<img>` tag, it is not self-closing. The `href` attribute holds the URL the link will open if clicked.

Some attributes are mandatory for a HTML tag to work, and others are optional.

<div class="todo">
  <ol>
    <li>Try to display an image in Codepen. Make sure you specify some alt-text.</li>
    <li>What happens when the URL in the src attribute doesn't lead to a valid image file?</li>
  </ol>
</div>
