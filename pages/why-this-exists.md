<p class="lede">These lessons aren't meant to make you an expert. You won't come out at the end of this course as a full-stack developer or cloud engineer. That takes much longer than six months.</p>

That said, they will help you learn:

* The ideas and technology responsible for the world wide web
* Parts of the [Government Service Standard ](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard)
* The [technology section of the Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology)
* How the [GOV.UK prototyping kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs) works

Most of all, Learn to code exists to show that **learning to code doesn't need to be daunting**.

## The team
These lessons are created and maintained by a volunteer team of DDaT fast streamers.

We're always looking for new subject matter experts, content designers and user researchers to refine our offering. If you'd like to help us iterate and improve Learn to code, [get in touch](mailto:ddatcodelabs@gmail.com).
