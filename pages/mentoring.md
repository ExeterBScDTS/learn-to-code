<p class="lede">You can get help with these lessons from fellow learners and our volunteer mentors.</p>

We publish a new module every month, so everyone is learning the same material at the same time, and can help each other out.

If you get stuck, post in the *#ddat-codelabs* channel on the cross-government digital Slack.

If you can't access that Slack team, you can [email the Codelabs volunteers](mailto:ddatcodelabs@gmail.com) instead.
